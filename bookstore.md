## ✨ About the Project
Ink & Aura is designed to be more than just a list of books; it’s a digital experience. By combining high-quality imagery from Unsplash with a custom color scheme (`#FFDAB3` peach and `#574964` deep plum), the site evokes the feeling of walking into a premium physical bookstore.

### Key Sections:
1.  **Hero Header**: A full-screen immersive section with a call-to-action to "Explore Now."
2.  **Category Browser**: Clean, pill-shaped navigation for genres like Fiction, Self-Growth, and Mystery.
3.  **Featured Gallery**: A responsive grid showcasing curated titles with price tags and interactive buttons.
4.  **Newsletter**: A minimalist "Reading Circle" subscription area to drive user engagement.

## 🚀 Features
* **Sticky Navigation**: The header remains fixed at the top, allowing users to navigate the site regardless of scroll depth.
* **Hover Effects**: Interactive book cards that lift upwards (`transform: translateY`) and change shadows when hovered.
* **Responsive Design**: Utilizes CSS **Flexbox** and `flex-wrap` to ensure the layout looks great on both desktops and tablets.
* **Modern UI Elements**: Custom-styled search bars, rounded buttons, and consistent padding/margins for a "breathable" design.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5**: For semantic structuring of the webpage.
* **CSS3**: For custom layouts, animations, and the "Peach & Plum" theme.
* **Google Fonts**: Specifically the **Poppins** family (Weights: 300, 400, 600).
* **Unsplash**: For high-quality, high-resolution book photography.
