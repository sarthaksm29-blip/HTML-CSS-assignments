# 🌟 Happy New Year 2026: Habit Tracker Experience

A minimalist, high-end web experience designed to celebrate the New Year while promoting healthy daily consistency. This project combines smooth CSS animations, modern glassmorphism UI, and dynamic JavaScript-generated visual effects.

---

## 📖 What it Does
This project is a visual storytelling piece. Instead of a static greeting, it features a **sequenced reveal** of text that guides the user through essential daily habits:
* **Running & Physical Activity**: Encouraging 10k steps.
* **Health & Nutrition**: Reminders for hydration and clean eating.
* **Consistency**: The final message—*"Small habits. Big years."*—emphasizes the power of daily discipline.

The page uses a dynamic "Glitter Engine" to create an immersive, twinkling background that feels like a deep-space environment.

## 🛠️ What it Uses (Tech Stack)



* **HTML5**: Semantic structure for the landing page.
* **CSS3 (Advanced)**: 
    * **Glassmorphism**: Uses `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)` for a frosted-glass effect.
    * **Custom Keyframes**: Specialized `@keyframes` for the `twinkle` and `reveal` animations.
    * **Flexbox**: Ensuring the UI is perfectly centered and responsive across all screens.
* **JavaScript (ES6)**: 
    * **Dynamic Injection**: A loop that creates 50+ sparkle elements on the fly.
    * **Math Randomization**: Every sparkle has a randomized position, size, and animation delay to ensure no two visits look the same.
* **Typography**: Integrated with Google Fonts (**Inter** font family).
