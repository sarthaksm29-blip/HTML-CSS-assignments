## 🧐 About the Project
The "Motion" project was built to explore the "Build something beautiful" philosophy. It features a dual-column hero section: 
1. **Left Side**: Engaging copy and call-to-action buttons.
2. **Right Side**: A unique abstract hero illustration built entirely with **HTML/CSS shapes**.



## ✨ Key Features
* **Pure CSS Illustrations**: The geometric hero graphic (board, circle, and square) is crafted using CSS `position: absolute`, `border-radius`, and `transform`.
* **Glassmorphism Effects**: Soft shadows and rounded corners create a "card-on-gradient" depth effect.
* **Responsive Wrapper**: A centered 1100px container that adapts gracefully to different screen resolutions.
* **Interactive UI**: 
    * **Smooth Hover States**: Navigation links and buttons feature `0.3s` ease-in-out transitions.
    * **Button Elevations**: The primary button utilizes `box-shadow` and `translateY` on hover for a tactile feel.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5**: Semantic tags for layout structure.
* **CSS3**:
    * **Flexbox**: For navigation and hero section alignment.
    * **CSS Gradients**: `linear-gradient(135deg, ...)` for the immersive background.
    * **Custom Fonts**: Implementation of the clean `Segoe UI` system stack.
