# SVG Graphics & Animation Assignment 🚀

This repository contains a specialized exploration of **Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)**. The project demonstrates how to create complex visual elements, custom branding, and interactive animations using pure HTML and XML-based drawing instructions.

## 📝 Project Overview

This project showcases the versatility of SVGs by moving beyond simple images into the world of coordinate-based math and declarative animations. It serves as a technical demonstration of how to build high-quality, resolution-independent graphics that remain crisp at any zoom level.

### Key Features:
* **Vector Geometry:** Implementation of custom Polygons (Pentagons and Stars) and complex Paths.
* **Typography in SVG:** Stylized text rendering with custom stroke and fill properties.
* **SMIL Animations:** Native SVG animations including scaling, rotation, opacity pulsing, and path-stroke drawing.
* **Zero Dependencies:** Built entirely with standard HTML5; no external CSS or JavaScript libraries required.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5** | Document structure and containerization. |
| **SVG 2.0** | Vector graphics rendering and coordinate mapping. |
| **SMIL** | Native declarative animations for SVG elements. |

## 📸 Visual Examples

### 1. Static Shapes and Branding
The code creates custom logos and geometric shapes using precise coordinate points.


### 2. Motion Graphics
The project includes several animation types such as a pulsating circle and a rotating square.

## 📈 Future Improvements

To further enhance this project, the following features could be added:
* **Responsiveness:** Use the `viewBox` attribute to ensure graphics scale perfectly across mobile and desktop devices.
* **CSS Keyframes:** Transition the animations from SMIL to CSS `@keyframes` for better performance and support in modern browsers like Safari.
* **Interactivity:** Add JavaScript `EventListener` functions to trigger animations based on user clicks or mouse hovers.
* **Accessibility (A11y):** Integrate `<title>` and `<desc>` tags within each SVG for better screen-reader support.
