## 🌟 About the Project
This project serves as a "digital diary" designed to showcase my identity, skills, and interests. It transitions from a personal introduction into a structured display of technical skills and favorite interests, like football and music.

## ✨ Core Features
* **Professional Introduction**: A clean header and summary section describing my journey and philosophy.
* **Skill Visualization**: Categorized lists using nested HTML tags to separate Frontend and Backend expertise.
* **Data Representation**: A structured table showcasing "Favorite Ballers" including player names, clubs, and nationalities.
* **Interactive Media**: A custom JavaScript-powered audio player that allows users to play and pause background music.
* **Modern Aesthetics**: A dark-themed UI featuring a slate background (`#0f172a`) and sky-blue accents.
* **Smooth Animations**: Hover effects on images (like the LinkedIn icon) using CSS transitions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5**: Semantic elements, tables for data, and media integration.
* **CSS3**: Custom variables, hover effects (scale transitions), and `system-ui` typography for a native feel.
* **JavaScript**: Basic DOM manipulation for the audio toggle logic.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
To take this project to the next level, I plan to:
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Implement `@media` queries to ensure the site looks perfect on mobile devices.
- [ ] **Code Optimization**: Consolidate the multiple `<html>` tags into a single valid document for better SEO.
- [ ] **Contact Form**: Add a functional contact section using a backend service like Formspree.
- [ ] **Theme Switcher**: Allow users to toggle between Light and Dark modes.
